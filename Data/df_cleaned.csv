Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.ABOUT THE ROLE:


 * Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.* Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.


WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:




* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.* You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:




* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.ABOUT THE ROLE:


 * Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.* Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.


WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:




* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.* You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:




* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GithubWhat We Value

"Forward Deployed Software Engineer, New Grad",$37K - $85K (Glassdoor est.),"A World-Changing Company
At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.
The Role
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. An internship as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could while improving the world around you. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” You'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, and finance, learn from experts in these fields about the problems they face and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them, and lead the process of finding answers. 
As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. You'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll also have the resources of a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend. 
You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you'll be ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

FDSE principles include:
• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage.

Our primary languages are Ruby with some Scala, PHP, React + TypeScript. Architecturally we use REST APIs, gRPC, and we leverage a host of internal deployment and cloud infrastructure tools.

Be a member of our Identity and Access Management Team that powers our authentication and authorization throughout the platform. You'll be working with team members to extend our products and integrate with a broad array of internal and external services. BigCommerce offers a heavily collaborative environment helping you expand your skill set and take ideas from inception to delivery.

What You'll Do

Experience with Scala, PHP, or React.js is a plus
Think iteratively by breaking down problems into smaller, deliverable / deployable pieces.

Experience with Google Cloud Platform or Cloud Computing highly desirable
Experience in highly scalable service-oriented architectures

Knowledge of RBAC and Authentication concepts a strong plus

What is an IAM Framework?

Authentication

Authentication is the area through which a user provides sufficient credentials to gain initial access to an application system or a particular resource. Once a user is authenticated, a session is created and referred during the interaction between the user and the application system until the user logs off or the session is terminated by other means (e.g. timeout).

It usually comes with a password service module when the user ID /password authentication method is used. By centrally maintaining the session of a user, it provides Single-Sign-On service so that the user needs not logon again on accessing another application system or resource governed under the same IAM Framework.

Authorization

Authorization is the area that determines whether a user is permitted to access a particular resource. Authorization is performed by checking the resource access request, typically in the form of an URL in web-based application, against authorization policies that are stored in an IAM policy store. Authorization is the core area that implements role-based access control. Moreover, the authorization model could provide complex access controls based on data or information or policies including user attributes, user roles /groups, actions taken, access channels, time, resources requested, external data and business rules.

User Management

This area comprises of user management, password management, role/ group management and user /group provisioning. It defines the set of administrative functions such as identity creation, propagation, and maintenance of user identity and privileges. One of its components is user life cycle management that enables an enterprise to manage the lifespan of a user account, from the initial stage of provisioning to the final stage of de-provisioning.

Some of the user management functions should be centralized while others should be delegated to end users. Delegated administration allows an enterprise to directly distribute workload to user departmental units. Delegation can also improve the accuracy of system data by assigning the responsibility of updates to persons closest to the situation and information.

Self-service is another key concept within user management. Through self-profile management service an enterprise benefits from timely update and accurate maintenance of identity data. Another popular self-service function is self-password reset, which significantly alleviates the help desk workload to handle password reset requests.

User management requires an integrated workflow capability to approve some user actions such as user account provisioning and de-provisioning.

Central User Repository

Central User Repository stores and delivers identity information to other services, and provides service to verify credentials submitted from clients

How an organization can benefit from implementing IAM?

Business value improves when an organization can appropriately protect its information assets. IAM provides the kind of reliability and accessibility to user access control that is imperative to most e-business sites these days.

IAM can enable new users, employees or contractors to gain necessary information from applications so that they can be productive and at the same time allow the organization to keep a check on the access rights as their roles require.

The key benefits of implementing IAM are as follows:


Facilitating the identification of loop holes in control points by phased approach of providing access controls
Enhancing business value by improving security
Improving compliance with various industry regulations and creating opportunities for new business initiatives,
Reducing overall effort of IT administration
Improving the productivity of employees and other members,
More effective customer support
Streamlining IT management in large organizations for enhancing overall ROI for business
Providing scalable approach that enables IT expansion in growing organizations

What is an IAM Framework?

Authentication

Authentication is the area through which a user provides sufficient credentials to gain initial access to an application system or a particular resource. Once a user is authenticated, a session is created and referred during the interaction between the user and the application system until the user logs off or the session is terminated by other means (e.g. timeout).

It usually comes with a password service module when the user ID /password authentication method is used. By centrally maintaining the session of a user, it provides Single-Sign-On service so that the user needs not logon again on accessing another application system or resource governed under the same IAM Framework.

Authorization

Authorization is the area that determines whether a user is permitted to access a particular resource. Authorization is performed by checking the resource access request, typically in the form of an URL in web-based application, against authorization policies that are stored in an IAM policy store. Authorization is the core area that implements role-based access control. Moreover, the authorization model could provide complex access controls based on data or information or policies including user attributes, user roles /groups, actions taken, access channels, time, resources requested, external data and business rules.

User Management

This area comprises of user management, password management, role/ group management and user /group provisioning. It defines the set of administrative functions such as identity creation, propagation, and maintenance of user identity and privileges. One of its components is user life cycle management that enables an enterprise to manage the lifespan of a user account, from the initial stage of provisioning to the final stage of de-provisioning.

Some of the user management functions should be centralized while others should be delegated to end users. Delegated administration allows an enterprise to directly distribute workload to user departmental units. Delegation can also improve the accuracy of system data by assigning the responsibility of updates to persons closest to the situation and information.

Self-service is another key concept within user management. Through self-profile management service an enterprise benefits from timely update and accurate maintenance of identity data. Another popular self-service function is self-password reset, which significantly alleviates the help desk workload to handle password reset requests.

User management requires an integrated workflow capability to approve some user actions such as user account provisioning and de-provisioning.

Central User Repository

Central User Repository stores and delivers identity information to other services, and provides service to verify credentials submitted from clients

How an organization can benefit from implementing IAM?

Business value improves when an organization can appropriately protect its information assets. IAM provides the kind of reliability and accessibility to user access control that is imperative to most e-business sites these days.

IAM can enable new users, employees or contractors to gain necessary information from applications so that they can be productive and at the same time allow the organization to keep a check on the access rights as their roles require.

The key benefits of implementing IAM are as follows:


Facilitating the identification of loop holes in control points by phased approach of providing access controls
Enhancing business value by improving security
Improving compliance with various industry regulations and creating opportunities for new business initiatives,
Reducing overall effort of IT administration
Improving the productivity of employees and other members,
More effective customer support
Streamlining IT management in large organizations for enhancing overall ROI for business
Providing scalable approach that enables IT expansion in growing organizations

Our Hiring Processes Might Include

We want to see your problem-solving and analytical skills. Be prepared to write good, clean, scalable code. You don't need to know our entire stack, but we're looking for practical experience, someone who can solve production problems in the cloud.

"Forward Deployed Software Engineer, New Grad - US Government",$71K - $150K (Glassdoor est.),"A World-Changing Company
At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.
The Role
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Being an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could while improving the world around you. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” You'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, and finance, learn from experts in these fields about the problems they face and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them, and lead the process of finding answers. 
As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. You'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll also have the resources of a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend. 
You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you'll be ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

FDSE principles include:
• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Technologies We Use
With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly as solving the problems you'll face may require expanding your skillset. And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

We use:
• Core Palantir products, which provide the foundations for our deployments• Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms• Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing• Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools• Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies• Python for data processing and analysis• Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3What We Value





Strong engineering background; preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or Physics.Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.Willingness and interest to travel to other Palantir offices and/or client sites as needed.Active US Security clearance or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.

The U.S. has $1.5 trillion worth of home transactions each year, generating over $120 billion of fees in a process that has changed little in decades. For the average American, the home purchase and sale process takes months, creates anxiety and is filled with uncertainty and hassle.

Orchard offers a modern alternative, making one of life's biggest decisions -- the sale and purchase of a home stress free, fair and simple.

We are headquartered in New York City, have 200+ employees and have grown 10x year over year. In addition to this incredible growth, we're proud to have been recognized by Inc. Magazine as a Best Workplace of 2020 while hold a 4.9 Glassdoor rating!

Low ego with appetite for feedback: we value humility and sharing + receiving feedback for growth and continuous improvement
Business empathy & clear communication: we work with product, design & business stakeholders collaboratively from early in the design process. We look for engineers to frame technical problems in the context of business value and be able to communicate with cross-functional teams
Prioritization & value orientation: we operate with agile principles and balance long-term planning with re-evaluating priorities based on new data and assumptions

Entry-level Software Engineer,$88K - $153K (Glassdoor est.),"OverviewAzavea is a technology firm based in Philadelphia that uses geospatial data to build software and data analytics for the web. As a B Corporation, our mission is to use advanced geospatial technology for positive civic, social, and environmental impact. Most of our work deals with local governments, non-profit organizations, and academic or federal research projects. We build custom web applications, perform geospatial analysis, and contribute to open source projects. Our engineers work across the technology stack, from modern browser-based front-ends to robust service-based backends residing on scalable infrastructure. Find out more about careers at Azavea here.We are looking for an entry-level Software Engineer who is passionate about building applications that will have a positive impact. Ideal candidates are interested in public service, but not necessarily in working for a government or a non-profit organization.We’re excited about what we do, we’re growing, and we hope you will join us.Skills & RequirementsAs an entry-level Software Engineer on the Geospatial Applications team, we expect that you will already know how to write code in at least one programming language, and will have had some exposure to software development tools. You’ll also work with dedicated mentors to further learn the skills of the trade, and will gain real-world experience by working on an existing team to develop custom web software for our clients. Lately, we’ve been developing tools to conduct remote tree inventories and manage high-resolution medical imagery (which has more overlap with spatial data than you might expect). We also do a fair bit of work in the civic space. Our team maintains DistrictBuilder, an open-source, collaborative redistricting tool that will support redistricting after the 2020 Census, and the Cicero API, an Azavea product which provides access to a comprehensive database of elected officials and legislative districts.Our applications are mostly written in JavaScript or TypeScript (React, Angular) and Python (Django), but we use many other technologies from time to time. Almost all of our work revolves around maps and spatial data. If you haven’t worked with spatial technology before, don’t worry—many of our colleagues hadn’t when they joined us.What you'll do:Collaborate with other engineers to write backend and frontend code for both external and internal projects.Work with an engineering mentor to design and complete a training program to help you establish a solid foundation for your software engineering skills. This is expected to include: online coursework, client or product work, pair programming, a ""breakable toy"" project, weekly one-on-ones, interaction with other teams, and monthly assessments.Develop your mastery of software engineering tools such as source control, editors, containers, and virtual machines.Respond to feedback from other engineers via code review, and internalize engineering best practices.Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process.Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.You should:Be able to write and debug code in at least one language, preferably Python or Javascript.Have an understanding of the function of core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and the role that they play in web applications.Be familiar with at least one database system, preferably PostgreSQL or MySQL.*Be familiar with command-line environments.*Have excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.Be interested in working with small teams on meaningful projects.* We don't expect you to have worked extensively with these technologies.Additional experience we find valuable (but not required):Familiarity with open source or commercial GIS software like Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS, PostGIS, or ArcGIS Server.Experience with a GitHub based workflow that includes pull requests and code reviews.Delivering and operating applications using cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP or Heroku.Working with virtualization technology or containers.Making technical decisions and owning outcomes.You’ll notice that we don’t cite a specific type of experience or a Computer Science degree as requirements. We are primarily looking for people who are excited about our mission and are ready to begin a software engineering career (including people who are changing careers). If you think this description fits you, even if your experience doesn't match up perfectly with the technologies we've listed, we encourage you to apply. We do not use automated resume screening technology, and our employees review all applications that we receive.A note on hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic Due to regulations in Philadelphia, and our concern for the health and safety of our team, we will be conducting all interviews remotely for the foreseeable future. While this position is on-site, and the majority of our staff generally work out of our Philadelphia office, we have transitioned the entire company to remote work. If the office remains closed at the time of hiring, we have made arrangements for remote on-boarding, including shipping relevant materials and a laptop to the new hire’s home. We are fortunate to have invested in meaningful work-from-home tools and processes over the years, and have been able to continue providing a secure, flexible, and safe work environment for all of our colleagues. We ask for your patience as we adapt our hiring process as well, and are happy to answer any questions or concerns about the process. Office and BenefitsOur Philadelphia headquarters is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market, and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, showers, and lockers. The office itself is assembled as an open office plan with many smaller rooms and flexible spaces for team meetings and concentration time. You get your own desk with a Linux workstation or Apple laptop and extra monitors. We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule. After the first six months, our staff can also spend up to 10% of their time on an open source, professional development, or R&D project. Recent 10% time projects include experiments with machine learning, React Native, and various forms of serverless processing with Amazon Lambda.We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package that includes:	- Fully subsidized health care, dental care, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children	- Fully subsidized life and long-term disability insurance, plus voluntary short-term disability insurance	- Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not	- Retirement plan with matching percentage	- Almost 4 weeks paid vacation plus additional paid sick/personal time off	- Family and medical leave	- Flexible work schedule	- Paid parental leave	- Child care subsidy	- Paid time off for voting and volunteering	- Education assistance plan	- Student loan assistance	- Public transit and biking reimbursement plans	- Monthly guest lectures with lunches on the company	- 10% time for research or learning projects	- Profit-sharing bonus plan	- Financial transparency through an open book policy	- Kind, capable and thoughtful colleaguesWe welcome qualified candidates from all walks of life and value diversity in our company. We prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, veteran status, military service, disability unrelated to job requirements, marital status, or domestic partner status.Below we have provided additional clarification for the Code and Writing Sample Questions on the Application.Code Sample Question (optional)Please supply a code sample that best reflects your work as an engineer. Put another way, use a code sample that you’re proud of, or took you awhile to get into a working state.This is valuable to us because it provides an objective way to assess your ability to write code in the real world. We find that writing code under real-world conditions (adheres to user requirements, works within an existing codebase, makes use of modules written by others, etc.) has an interesting way of forcing unexpected decisions and tradeoffs to be made.This could be submitted as a direct link to a merge request or a source control management patch hosted by an online paste tool (GitHub Gist, CodePen, JSFiddle, etc.).Please submit a small amount of code, such as a single function implementation or a medium-sized changeset. Large changesets or entire projects are more difficult for us to review, especially if they were created collaboratively.This question is optional because we know that not all candidates for an entry-level position will have existing code that they are able to share.Writing Sample QuestionPlease supply a technical writing sample.This is valuable to us because we are asked to write a lot, and we value clear and concise communication. Many of our interactions with colleagues (merge request descriptions, issue comments, Slack chats, etc.) and clients (emails, proposals, contracts, etc.) happen through written communication.Below are some examples:- A blog post on a technical issue- A technical architectural document- A block comment from your source code- A comment on a mailing list or forumIf you are unable to share any existing technical writing samples, please submit a short sample responding to one of the following prompts:- Describe a process, technology, language, framework, concept, or technique that you've learned recently.- Describe a tricky bug that you've encountered and how you approached debugging it.- Describe a challenging technical problem you've faced and the solution you ultimately chose.- If you are submitting a code sample, describe what it does and any noteworthy tradeoffs you had to make during the implementation process.Clear and concise answers are better than long ones. The text field for submission has a pretty sizable character limit, but please try to keep your submission to 300 words or less.The deadline for this application is February 1, 2021.",-1.0,"Azavea
