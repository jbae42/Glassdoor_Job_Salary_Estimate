Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.ABOUT THE ROLE:


 * Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.* Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.


WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:




* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.* You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:




* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GithubWhat We Value

"Forward Deployed Software Engineer, New Grad",$37K - $85K (Glassdoor est.),"A World-Changing Company
At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.
The Role
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. An internship as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could while improving the world around you. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” You'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, and finance, learn from experts in these fields about the problems they face and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them, and lead the process of finding answers. 
As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. You'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll also have the resources of a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend. 
You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you'll be ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

FDSE principles include:
• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Technologies We Use
With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly as solving the problems you'll face may require expanding your skillset. And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

We use:
• Core Palantir products, which provide the foundations for our deployments• Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms• Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing• Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools• Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies• Python for data processing and analysis• Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3What We Value





Strong engineering background; preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or Physics.Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.Willingness and interest to travel to other Palantir offices and/or client sites as needed.

What is an IAM Framework?

Authentication

Authentication is the area through which a user provides sufficient credentials to gain initial access to an application system or a particular resource. Once a user is authenticated, a session is created and referred during the interaction between the user and the application system until the user logs off or the session is terminated by other means (e.g. timeout).

It usually comes with a password service module when the user ID /password authentication method is used. By centrally maintaining the session of a user, it provides Single-Sign-On service so that the user needs not logon again on accessing another application system or resource governed under the same IAM Framework.

Authorization

Authorization is the area that determines whether a user is permitted to access a particular resource. Authorization is performed by checking the resource access request, typically in the form of an URL in web-based application, against authorization policies that are stored in an IAM policy store. Authorization is the core area that implements role-based access control. Moreover, the authorization model could provide complex access controls based on data or information or policies including user attributes, user roles /groups, actions taken, access channels, time, resources requested, external data and business rules.

User Management

This area comprises of user management, password management, role/ group management and user /group provisioning. It defines the set of administrative functions such as identity creation, propagation, and maintenance of user identity and privileges. One of its components is user life cycle management that enables an enterprise to manage the lifespan of a user account, from the initial stage of provisioning to the final stage of de-provisioning.

Some of the user management functions should be centralized while others should be delegated to end users. Delegated administration allows an enterprise to directly distribute workload to user departmental units. Delegation can also improve the accuracy of system data by assigning the responsibility of updates to persons closest to the situation and information.

Self-service is another key concept within user management. Through self-profile management service an enterprise benefits from timely update and accurate maintenance of identity data. Another popular self-service function is self-password reset, which significantly alleviates the help desk workload to handle password reset requests.

User management requires an integrated workflow capability to approve some user actions such as user account provisioning and de-provisioning.

Central User Repository

Central User Repository stores and delivers identity information to other services, and provides service to verify credentials submitted from clients

How an organization can benefit from implementing IAM?

Business value improves when an organization can appropriately protect its information assets. IAM provides the kind of reliability and accessibility to user access control that is imperative to most e-business sites these days.

IAM can enable new users, employees or contractors to gain necessary information from applications so that they can be productive and at the same time allow the organization to keep a check on the access rights as their roles require.

The key benefits of implementing IAM are as follows:


Facilitating the identification of loop holes in control points by phased approach of providing access controls
Enhancing business value by improving security
Improving compliance with various industry regulations and creating opportunities for new business initiatives,
Reducing overall effort of IT administration
Improving the productivity of employees and other members,
More effective customer support
Streamlining IT management in large organizations for enhancing overall ROI for business
Providing scalable approach that enables IT expansion in growing organizations

What is an IAM Framework?

Authentication

Authentication is the area through which a user provides sufficient credentials to gain initial access to an application system or a particular resource. Once a user is authenticated, a session is created and referred during the interaction between the user and the application system until the user logs off or the session is terminated by other means (e.g. timeout).

It usually comes with a password service module when the user ID /password authentication method is used. By centrally maintaining the session of a user, it provides Single-Sign-On service so that the user needs not logon again on accessing another application system or resource governed under the same IAM Framework.

Authorization

Authorization is the area that determines whether a user is permitted to access a particular resource. Authorization is performed by checking the resource access request, typically in the form of an URL in web-based application, against authorization policies that are stored in an IAM policy store. Authorization is the core area that implements role-based access control. Moreover, the authorization model could provide complex access controls based on data or information or policies including user attributes, user roles /groups, actions taken, access channels, time, resources requested, external data and business rules.

User Management

This area comprises of user management, password management, role/ group management and user /group provisioning. It defines the set of administrative functions such as identity creation, propagation, and maintenance of user identity and privileges. One of its components is user life cycle management that enables an enterprise to manage the lifespan of a user account, from the initial stage of provisioning to the final stage of de-provisioning.

Some of the user management functions should be centralized while others should be delegated to end users. Delegated administration allows an enterprise to directly distribute workload to user departmental units. Delegation can also improve the accuracy of system data by assigning the responsibility of updates to persons closest to the situation and information.

Self-service is another key concept within user management. Through self-profile management service an enterprise benefits from timely update and accurate maintenance of identity data. Another popular self-service function is self-password reset, which significantly alleviates the help desk workload to handle password reset requests.

User management requires an integrated workflow capability to approve some user actions such as user account provisioning and de-provisioning.

Central User Repository

Central User Repository stores and delivers identity information to other services, and provides service to verify credentials submitted from clients

How an organization can benefit from implementing IAM?

Business value improves when an organization can appropriately protect its information assets. IAM provides the kind of reliability and accessibility to user access control that is imperative to most e-business sites these days.

IAM can enable new users, employees or contractors to gain necessary information from applications so that they can be productive and at the same time allow the organization to keep a check on the access rights as their roles require.

The key benefits of implementing IAM are as follows:


Facilitating the identification of loop holes in control points by phased approach of providing access controls
Enhancing business value by improving security
Improving compliance with various industry regulations and creating opportunities for new business initiatives,
Reducing overall effort of IT administration
Improving the productivity of employees and other members,
More effective customer support
Streamlining IT management in large organizations for enhancing overall ROI for business
Providing scalable approach that enables IT expansion in growing organizations

Our Hiring Processes Might Include

We want to see your problem-solving and analytical skills. Be prepared to write good, clean, scalable code. You don't need to know our entire stack, but we're looking for practical experience, someone who can solve production problems in the cloud.

"Forward Deployed Software Engineer, New Grad - US Government",$71K - $150K (Glassdoor est.),"A World-Changing Company
At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.
The Role
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Being an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could while improving the world around you. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” You'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, and finance, learn from experts in these fields about the problems they face and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them, and lead the process of finding answers. 
As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. You'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll also have the resources of a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend. 
You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you'll be ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

FDSE principles include:
• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Technologies We Use
With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly as solving the problems you'll face may require expanding your skillset. And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

We use:
• Core Palantir products, which provide the foundations for our deployments• Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms• Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing• Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools• Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies• Python for data processing and analysis• Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3What We Value





Strong engineering background; preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or Physics.Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.Willingness and interest to travel to other Palantir offices and/or client sites as needed.Active US Security clearance or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.
